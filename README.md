# archdi

Just a simple bash script to install and configure a full personal computer with Arch Linux.

First, install Arch Linux with the official m√©dia and optionally with archfi.<br />
Look at archfi project to start your arch linux installation : https://github.com/MatMoul/archfi

After reboot, type the next two lines :

curl -L matmoul.github.io/archdi<br />
sh archdi

you can install it on your system with<br />
sh archdi -i<br />
And then you can use archdi cmd.<br />
With this, you can make your updates or install packages later.

You can watch my videos to show how to use it :<br />
